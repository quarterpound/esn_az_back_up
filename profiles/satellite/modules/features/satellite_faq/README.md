# Satellite FAQ

This is a example module that adds optional functionality to the Satellite 4.
It is a feature that is self contained, with CSS and JS loaded when needed and part of the package.

It can be enabled without other features being overridden and it can be disabled without the satellite exploding.

The main git branch for this feature is 7.x-1.x like any versioned drupal module should.

Please keep all other enhancements in the same fashion.
