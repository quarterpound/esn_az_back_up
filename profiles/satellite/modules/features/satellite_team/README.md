# Satellite team

Team members of the Satellite site are users (from Galaxy)

satellite_team extends the functionality of esn_user and adds new fields to the user.
satellite_team could use profile2 or similar.

The important part is that not every user is necessarily a team member. but users who are can edit their own profile.
